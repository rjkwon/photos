  "blurb": "This park contains some of the most beautiful natural wonders I've seen in my life (I literally said \"it's so grand\" out loud multiple times). There's a short walk to the waterfall, Nugget Falls, and I was completely overwhelmed with emotion when I saw the landscape. It was cold and rainy but having a good poncho and water resistant hiking boots, plus very few people on the trails, made it a top tier hike."
