  "blurb": "I love winter. For the past two years, we've made a pilgrimage upstate to hunker down and get cozy for about a month or so in the dead of winter. I challenged myself to go outside for at least one walk each day regardless of the weather, and now it's become a habit I enjoy. Winter walks are quieter and calmer than summer walks (and less sweaty). I wrote a little bit about wintering on the blog."
