  "blurb": "This is my dad's favorite nature walk in San Francisco. I like that it has nice views but still feels kinda urban. Our family usually spends Thanksgiving in the Bay Area, so this must have been around the holiday. The ruins of the Sutro Baths and the giant camera obscura are cool landmarks."
